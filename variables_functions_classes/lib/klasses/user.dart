/// `classes`
/// A `class` is a blueprint of an object.
/// Every `object` is an instance of a `class`.
/// 
/// 
/// `constructors`
/// A `constructor` a special type of function which is used to create an instance
/// of a `class`. Declare a `constructor` by creating a function with the same 
/// name as its `class`.
/// A `method` is a function within a `class`.
/// 
/// 
/// A `constructor` in dart can be:
/// Subclasses don’t inherit constructors from their superclass. 
/// A subclass that declares no constructors has only the default
/// (no argument, no name) constructor.
/// 
/// 1. `default` -> If you don’t declare a constructor, a default constructor 
/// is provided for you. The default constructor has no arguments and invokes 
/// the no-argument constructor in the superclass.
/// 2. `named` ->  
/// 1. `positional` -> 
/// 1. `positional` ->

/// `const` vs `final`
/// (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dart-const-and-final-keyword/#:~:text=The%20only%20difference%20between%20final,considered%20frozen%20and%20completely%20immutable.)
/// 
/// The `final` keyword is used to hardcode the values of the variable and it
/// cannot be altered in future, neither any kind of operations performed on
/// these variables can alter its value (state).
/// 
/// The `const` keyword in Dart behaves exactly like the final keyword. 
/// The only difference between `final` and `const` is that the const makes 
/// the variable constant from compile-time only. Using const on an object,
/// makes the object’s entire deep state strictly 
/// fixed at `compile-time` and that the object with this state will be
/// considered frozen and completely immutable.
